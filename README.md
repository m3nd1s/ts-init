# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
1. You can initiate a basic typescript starter project in the directory of your choice by cloning the repo to your chosen dir (`git clone <reponame> .`)
2. The following lifecycle commands are added by default:
    - start : runs the `src/index.ts` file without building it, with `ts-node`
    - build : builds the `.ts` files to a `dist/` folder in project root
3. TIP: Add the following alias to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_aliases`:
    ```Shell
    alias ts-init='git clone https://github.com/m3nd1s/ts-init.git . && git remote remove origin'
    ```
